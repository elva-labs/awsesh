## SSO's with a large number of accounts

There is an issue of running into 429s (too many requests) when trying to fetch roles on a large number of accounts.
To sidestep that issue we only automatically fetch the roles if there are less than 30 accounts.
If there are more they will be lazy loaded when trying to access the role selection.
Hopefully I'll find a better solution in the future.
